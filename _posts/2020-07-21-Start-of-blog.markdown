So I have been meaning to get around to starting a blog for a while. With the current Covid-19 pandemic going on and being stuck home I figured that this would be as good a time as any to get it up and running. I am using the static site generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for this blog. I am newish to yaml and markdown having used just basic html and templates for my sites so its a great learning opportunity! 

This blog is going to cover and document all of my random projects with my servers or home-improvement.
